## Project Overview
In this project for my HCDE 410 Human Data Interaction class I explore the question, "Are books better than movies?" by looking in to comparing the popularity of books to their movie adaption. I use 3 different data sources to create a set that contains the information about of books and their movie adaptions. From here I will use a two-sample t-test for independent data to see if there is statstical significance around if books ratings are greater or less than their movie adaptions ratings. I will display these findings as either a boxplot or a scatterplot.
